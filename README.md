### Tasks

The project is still under development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- [x] Comparing different cenarios for stability of PI-Controlled first order processes: constant time-delay ‚ùå time-varying time-delay
- [x] For the Skogestad-IMC PI Controller proposed in "Simple analytic rules for model reduction and PID controller tuning", 2003, Skogestad, verifying what's the worst cenario for the stability of the PI-Controlled closed-loop system: constant time-delay or time-varying time-delay in a first order model
- [ ] Computationally Analysing the stability in the frequency domain for better understanding what's the worst situation for a PI-Controlled first order process
- [ ] Analysing the stability in the time domain (Lyapunov-Krasovskii, Razumikhin...) to find less conservative conditions to tell what's the worst case time-delay for a PI-Controlled first order process
- [ ] Testing the theoretical results in a intensive care unit in order to verify the stability conditions proposed

## üíª Requirements to start this project:

Before starting, make sure you've met the following requirements:
* You have installed MATLAB (https://matlab.mathworks.com/).
* You want to better understand the effects of time-varying delay in first order processes controlled by a Proportional-Integral Controller!
